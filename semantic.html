    <h4>semantic HTML</h4>
    <p>&lt; header &gt;: The header tag defines content that should be considered the introductory information of a page or section</p>
    
      <nav>: The navigation tag is used for navigation links. It can be nested within the <header> tag, but secondary navigation <nav> tags are also commonly used elsewhere on the page.
      <main>: This tag contains the main content (also called the body) of a page. There should be only one tag per page.
      <article>: The article tag defines content that could stand independently of the page or site it’s on. It does not necessarily mean a “blog post.” Think of it more as “an article of clothing”—a self-contained item that can be used in various contexts.
      <section>: Using <section> is a way of grouping nearby content of a similar theme. A section tag differs from an article tag. It isn’t necessarily self-contained, but it forms part of something else. 
      <aside>: An aside element defines content that’s less important. It’s often used for sidebars—areas that add complementary but nonessential information.
      <footer>: You use <footer> at the bottom of a page. It usually includes contact information, copyright information, and some site navigation.
        <details>	Defines additional details that the user can view or hide
          <figcaption>	Defines a caption for a <figure> element
          <figure>	Specifies self-contained content, like illustrations, diagrams, photos, code listings, etc.
            <mark>	Defines marked/highlighted text
              <section>	Defines a section in a document
              <summary>	Defines a visible heading for a <details> element
              <time>	Defines a date/time
    <p>Gründe:</p>

      <li>accessability</li>
      <li>help search engines to determine importance of context</li>
      <li>better user experience</li>
      <li>easier to read</li>
